Different steps were required to achieve this project
* Define the grammar
* Model to text
* Define a playlist model
* Model to Model to text
* Jhipster Website

## Technologies

We used many technologies, you can find the list below:

* [Xtext] - Generate grammar
* [Xtend] - Language
* [EMF] - Metamodel with Ecore and Genmodel
* [JHIPSTER] - A Yeoman generator 
* [Flowplayer] - An HTML5 video player

## Architecture

### Models
   Contains the Videogen model + YOGO grammar and the Playlist Model
   
### Xtend
   Contains all transformations: Model to text, text to Model, vignettes
   
### src
 Contains the JHISPTER app

## Deployment
* Jhipster authentification is: user/user
* Use of Heroku for deployment: https://www.heroku.com/
